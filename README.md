# Statistics
The coursework of STAT120 (Introduction to Statistics) and STAT220 (Data Science) at Carleton College.

These courses used the programming language R to learn and conduct statistical computation and visualization. This included the following:
- a folder *Data Science* containing:
  - weekly assignments used to learn statistical methods in R
  - a shiny app with two visualizations that explore the statistics from the GitHub data source <a href="https://github.com/APM-Reports/jury-data">The Role of Race in Jury Selection </a>
  - a shiny app on movies across streaming services with three visualizations and a machine-learning predictor
- a folder *NHL_report_AM&BT* for a final project on NHL player statistics based on age from Introduction to Statistics that contains:
  - an R Markdown file *NHL_FinalReport.Rmd* containing the analysis and visualization code in R
  - a PDF *NHL_FinalReport.pdf* that contains the final written report
  - a CSV *NHL_playerStats.csv* containing data on NHL players from the 2021-22 season


These projects provided me with strong statistical analysis and visualization skills in R, as well as a baseline understanding of machine learning concepts.
